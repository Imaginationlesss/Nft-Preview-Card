# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview
  This was challenging project for me but I still finished it, I'm sure i haven't written code perfectly but it works so I'll take it as a win for now as this is only second project I've done so far and it's only been 2 weeks maybe since I started.
